How to run:

1. To start restore database Other/contacts.bak or run script Other/db.sql to any empty database and then run Pump test method from Contacts.Tests.DataPump.
2. Change "ConnectionStr" value.
3. Run the application.

Used technologies:
1. Nhibernate for ORM ( I prefer it over Entity framework because it is more flexible and it's faster. )
2. ASP.NET for server layer.
3. anglularjs for client.
